          review: 'Had an AMAZING dinner with my family with the help of Inclined Catering Co. not only was Josh professional and friendly, he helped me build the menu and everything tasted like perfection. Thank you for making this night so special! I only wish I had more photos of the spread but I was too busy eating it. I can not wait to use your services again in the near future.',

          review: 'Inclined Catering and Chef Josh were a pleasure to work with! They catered a fabulous meal for a milestone birthday party! Josh helped finalize a menu to work with our budget. The food was amazing (especially the prime rib) and they left the house cleaner than they found it! Such an awesome experience!',

Thank you for making this night so special! I only wish I had more photos of the spread but I was too busy eating it.This was money and time well spent, why did I ever eat in restaurants in the past when I could have had you cook for me personally?! I can not wait to use your services again in the near future.',
